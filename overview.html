<center><h3><b>Overview of the Sewerage System </b></h3></center>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Bangalore is located on the water shed of two principal river basins, Arkavathi to the west and South Pennar to the East. The local topography is characterised by a series of well defined valleys which radiate from a ridge of High Ground to the north of the city and fall in a gradual manner towards wide belt of flat land extending beyond the limits of the metropolitan area to the South. The Three principal valleys are known as Vrishabhavathi, Koramangala and Chellaghatta and the three valleys run generally in a north to the south direction and divide the greater part of the metropolitan area which lies to the south of the ridge into three separate and distinct drainage zones. A fourth valley system referred to as the Hebbal series forms drainage zone to the north of the ridge and runs in north easterly direction. Five minor valleys, the Kathriguppa and Tavarekere to the south, the Arkavathi and Kethamaranahally to the north west and Marathhally to the east, lie outside the tributary area of the major valleys and they drain independently to the fringe areas which form the remainder of the metropolitan area. The configuration of valleys in well graded side slopes of their tributary areas has provided Bangalore with a natural system of drainage without recourse to pumping. Both sewerage and storm water flow by gravity beyond the city.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">The system of sewers for the conveyance of domestic and industrial waste water through underground drainage system was introduced in the year 1922. The system introduced initially was confined to heavily populated area in the heart of the city and although a gradual extension took place then onwards it was not until 1950 that a major programme of sewer construction was commenced. With the formation of the Board (BWSSB) in 1964, the programme to provide Sewerage system in the unsewered areas was taken up in a phased manner and the treatment of sewage before it is led into the natural valleys was also tackled. It is estimated that roughly 1,400 MLD of wastewater flows through its three valleys – the Vrishabhavathi, the Koramangala - Challaghatta, and the Hebbal. The actual amount of sewage generated would be higher since a large number of private bore wells exist and there is no scientific estimate of the quantity of water withdrawn from them. Sewage flow in the city follows the regional topography and flow down along the three principal valleys and five minor valleys ensuring free flow of sewage without any major pumping requirement.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">The core area of Bengaluru was of 245 Sq. Kms which is the older part of the city. BWSSB has the jurisdiction in this area to supply potable water to the citizens and to collect, convey and treat the wastewater generated. Several schemes were implemented to supply water to the city. For collection of wastewater generated in the city about 3300 KMs of smaller diameter pipelines were laid. To convey the collected wastewater to the treatment plants, 300 KMs of higher diameter pipes were laid. Some of the pipelines were laid about 40 to 50 years back. Due to various reasons, viz. ageing of sewers, encroachment of sewers, damages in the sewerage system, crown corrosion of sewers, abuse of sewers, direct discharges from the houses built on the side of Storm Water Drain, direct discharges from Apartments, new layouts etc., a part of wastewater is flowing through Storm Water Drains and entering lakes and due to this the lakes are being polluted. Following are the details with regard to the existing sewerage system</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="content_list">
<ul>
	<li>Total length of sewer system - 6,800 Kms</li>
	<li>Number of manholes - 2.25 lakhs</li>
	<li>Sanitary house service connections - 9 lakhs</li>
	<li>Number of sewer cleaning combination (Jetting &amp; Sucking machines) for cleaning &amp; maintaining of sewer system - 125 nos</li>
	<li>Total no. of desilting machines - 6 nos.</li>
	<li>Sewerage network Laterals (&lt; 300 mm dia) – 3367 Kms</li>
	<li>Trunk Sewers (&gt;300 mm dia) – 302 Kms Number of plants – 14</li>
	<li>Sewage generation – 1400 MLD</li>
	<li>Sewage treatment capacity – 721 MLD</li>
	<li>Average treatment – 520 MLD</li>
</ul>
</div>
<center><h3>Core Area Sewage Network</h3></center>
<p>The lateral collection system starts from the houses and connected to sub mains. The problems in these networks will be addressed as and when required out of the Board funds. Whereas the problems of the higher diameter sewers involves huge costs and hence the projects are being prepared. After obtaining financial assistance, the works will be taken up. For treating the wastewater BWSSB has established 14 Wastewater treatment plants of 721 MLD capacity and the details are as under.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Environmental Action Plans (EAPs)</b> to avoid waste water flowing into storm water drains. The Board has taken up the following projects:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>a) Environmental Action Plan (EAP) – A: </b>This plan was initiated during 2001. 33 Kms of existing trunk sewers were replaced/ rehabilitated at a cost of Rs.54.00 crore. There was an increase of 40 MLD of sewage inflow into the STPs there by, reduction in wastewater flow in the SWD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>b) Hebbal STP Zero flow scheme:</b> In this scheme 18 Kms of trunk sewers were replaced/ rehabilitated at a cost of Rs. 45.00 Crore. The benefits of the scheme would be zero flow in the SWD upto Nagavara Lake. There is no entry of sewage to Hebbal and Nagavara Lakes from core area. The STP at Hebbal would be completely utilised. The increase in flow is 40 MLD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>c) Environmental Action Plan–B:</b> The project consists of replacement/ rehabilitation of 70 Kms of trunk sewers at a cost of Rs.176.00 Crore. It is estimated that 150 MLD of wastewater will be diverted into STPs after the completion of the project. The revised project cost is Rs.495 Crore. The work is expected to be completed by end of 2016.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Proposed Water Supply works </b></p>

<p>During the last two decades the city of Bangalore has been experiencing unprecedented growth in the field of Industrial, Commercial and Institutional sectors. This phenomenal growth has resulted in unplanned urban activities surrounding Bangalore and increase in population and construction activities. As per the census the population of Bangalore city was 4.08 million in 1991, 5.8 million in 2001 and increased to 8.5 million in 2011. This fast growth in population is posing tremendous pressure on infrastructure especially on water supply and under ground drainage system.</p>

<p>The projected water supply requirements for the city of Bangalore and population projections are shown in the table below:</p>

<p>Though, the Water supply and Sewerage system is available in Core area and 8 erstwhile ULBs, the comprehensive Water supply and Sewerage system does not exist in 110 village area. Existing Water supply to 110 villages is from bore well source. Now the increase in demand has necessitated looking for a reliable and organized / structured water supply source. There is no planned UGD system in 110 village areas. The present sanitation facilities are provided through house hold septic tanks and soak pits. There is no scientific collection system and sewage treatment facilities provided in the 110 village areas (except few layouts). In the absence of proper sewerage system, the sullage and raw sewage generated in various wards are discharged through open drains / nalas to nearby lakes / water bodies. This is adversely affecting the environment.</p>

<p>After formation of BBMP in 2007, the rapid growth and development has happened in the 110 village area. Based on this development the population has increased substantially. The rapid growth in these areas demands improvements in urban infrastructure like water supply, sewerage system and roads etc. The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has the responsibility for providing water supply and underground drainage system to Bangalore city including extended areas under BBMP.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Bulk water supply CWSS Stage V </b></p>

<p>Recently, the Urban Development Department, Govt. of Karnataka (GoK) allocated an additional 10 TMC (775 MLD) of Cauvery Water for Bangalore city. Formulation of CWSS Stage V scheme for Bangalore City and preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the same is completed for getting financial assistance from funding agencies, such as JICA (Japan International Co-operation Agency). Considering the technical aspects and water demand it is proposed to take up the Stage V Scheme in two Phases i.e., Phase I of 500 MLD (6.45 TMC) capacity and Phase II of 275 MLD (3.55 TMC) capacity. It is proposed to provide raw water transmission pipeline for 810 MLD flow, water treatment plant at T.K. Halli for minimum 500 MLD output and common facilities (Aerator, Raw Water Channel and all buildings) for 775 MLD Capacity, clear water pumping stations with mechanical and electrical works at three locations (T.K. Halli, Harohalli and Tataguni), clear water transmission system for 755 MLD up to the city entry (Vajarahalli) and city trunk main and city reservoirs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Water Supply and Sanitary Facilities to 110 Villages</b></p>

<p>A project is proposed and prepared for providing water supply &amp; UGD facilities to extended area of Bangalore City covering 110 Villages under BBMP. Project area is 225 Sq. Km. This project is to be taken up early to provide basic amenities of water supply and UGD system to the extended 110 village areas of Bangalore city. The DPR of the 5 zones (Dasarahalli, R.R Nagar, Bommanahalli, Mahadevapura and Byatarayanpura), has been now prepared based on the 2011 census details, for the projected population for the intermediate year 2034 and ultimate year 2049 as per CPHEEO guidelines.

<p><b>Proposed Sewerage System works</b></p>

<p>For effective conveyance of sewage from the core area, Environmental Action Plan – C for the balance 74 Kms of the trunk sewers out of 300 KMs of existing sewers is proposed. Action is being taken to prepare Detailed Project Report (DPR) by addressing all the inherent problems as well as the present scenario of the existing pipelines. The preparation of DPR will take 6 months time and the approximate cost of this project is about Rs 500 crores. It is expected that the increase in flow to the sewage treatment plants will be about 120 MLD.</p>

<p>Further, it is proposed to construct 6 new treatment plants of total capacity of 520 MLD for treating the additional wastewater generated. The DPRs for these projects have been prepared. The KUIDFC agreed to provide 50% of project cost as shown under megacity scheme. For 25% funding a proposal has been sent to Government. The Board will bear the balance 25% of the project cost. The total cost of the scheme as per the DPRs prepared is Rs.1373.42 crores. The details of the future plants are furnished below.</p>

<p>a) 150 MLD wastewater treatment plant at V Valley</p>

<p><br />
b) 100 MLD wastewater treatment plant at Hebbal</p>

<p><br />
c) 20 MLD wastewater treatment plant at K R Puram</p>

<p><br />
d) 150 MLD wastewater treatment plant at K &amp; C Valley</p>

<p><br />
e) 40 MLD wastewater treatment plant at Doddabele</p>

<p><br />
f) 60 MLD wastewater treatment plant at Bengaluru University</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To avoid pollution of Bellandur and Varthur lakes it is proposed to construct waste water treatment plants in the upstream areas of Hulimavu, Begur, Sarakki and Agarm. The Lake Development Authority have been requested to handover the required land for setting up of these plants near the lakes. For establishing and maintaining of these plants an amount of Rs.585 crore is required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Rain Water Harvesting, Rejuvenation of Lakes </b></p>

<p>Rain water and ground water are important components of the hydrological cycle. At an average rainfall of 750mm per year the total available rain water will be 33TMC in 1250 sq.km. area of Greater Bangalore. The Board can utilize 5 to 10 TMC of rain water that falls in and around the city by utilising the benefits of the complete remodelled storm water drains by BBMP, ensuring collection of all the sewage in the sewerage net work so that all the sewage is taken to the treatment plants. The rain water collected in shafts, galleries and lakes through the storm water drain net work will help in revival of the depleted groundwater level. About 30% of the treated effluent from the sewage treatment plants is led to the Lakes for dilution with rain water. Water that percolates into ground from these lakes increases the ground water level in vadose and phreatic zones. For studying the feasibility a consultancy has been entrusted and by the end of 2016 the DPR will be ready.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Financial Position of the Board </b></p>

<p>The major source of Revenue is from Water user Charges collected from the consumers. In addition to this, the Board generates revenue from other sources like Sanitary charges, prorata charges, borewell charges and bulk water supply to areas of Kanakapura Town and Tataguni gramapanchayat. The Board is executing some major capital intensive works like Cauvery Water Supply Scheme Stage IV Phase II, Greater Bangalore Water Supply and Karnataka Municipal Reforms Works with the assistance of Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and World Bank. The capital source of funds for this project is from JICA, Govt. of Karnataka , World Bank and Beneficiaries of this project. Some of the major heads of expenditures of the Board are power charges payable to BESCOM and CHESCOM, maintenance of bore wells in the city, and debt servicing of the loans borrowed towards projects executed by the Board in addition to committed expenditure like Establishment charges and Operation and Maintenance charges of the assets of the Board.</p>
&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>a) Revenue and Expenditure Position</b></p>

<p>1. The monthly Water Revenue Demand is about Rs.90.00 Crore during FY 2015-16</p>

<p>2. The monthly Water Revenue Collection is about Rs.80.00 Crore during FY 2015-16 and the expected Annual Revenue from all sources is Rs.1228.21 Crore.</p>

<p>3. The monthly Revenue Expenditure is Rs. 138.75 Crore towards all expenditures including repayment of Government Loan Principal and Intrest components and the expected Annual Expenditure is Rs.1665.07 Crore.</p>

<p>4. The Revenue gap is Rs.36.00 Cr per month and the Annual Revenue gap is Rs.436.00 Cr</p>

<p>5. The gap is due to increase in power tariff, increase in maintenance costs and other administration costs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>b) Loan Position </b></p>

<p>The total loan sanctioned by Government of Karnataka for various projects including CWSS IV Stage, Phase I &amp; CWSS Stage IV Phase II stands at Rs.3272.95 crore as at the end of 31st March 2014 (audited by AG). The total Outstanding Loans as at the end of 31st March 2015 is Rs.3597.36 Crore. The total interest payable on these loans is Rs.2085.72 Crore as at the end of 31st March 2015. The outstanding loans borrowed from institutions like LIC and KUIDFC is to the extent of Rs.155.87 Crore at the end of 31st March 2015.</p>
<span style="line-height: 1.6;">a) Due to financial constraints and accumulated deficit coupled with subsidized water being supplied to the economically vulnerable sections of the society, which is a major strain on the finances, the Board could not discharge the loan liability of the Government. The existing tariff is able to recover only O&amp;M cost. Unless tariff recovers the cost of debt from the general public, the Board will not be in a position to repay the loan, as BWSSB is not receiving any budgetary support from GoK.</span>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">b) BWSSB is also supplying water through public taps. No revenue is generated out of Public Taps. The Board has not received the water dues to the extent of Rs.207.64 crores out of which Rs.8.00 cores is due from BDA and Rs.154.00 Crores is due from BBMP on account of public taps. In spite of efforts the revenue dues have not been realized from BDA and BBMP.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">c) Further, the Board is entrusted with maintenance of borewell’s in the city. The borewell’s hitherto maintained by BBMP/ CMC’s are now handed over to BWSSB. The total Power Charges for pumping water to the city including energisation of these borewells works out to Rs.394.97 Crores per annum which consumes half of the Revenue Income of the Board.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">d) The present revenue of the Board is insufficient to meet the debt servicing. However the Board is discharging all institutional debts out of Board revenue itself .</span></p>

<p><b>Vision document upto 2050 </b></p>

<p>In order to develop an effective road map BWSSB has envisioned a vision document with strategic Master plan to address the future outlook and challenges.</p>

<p>Outcome of this study will include a holistic and integrated evaluation of all available and current water resources, including recycled water, and identification of alternatives and strategies, which can be further developed as future water resources. It will result into a vision document which will have identified potential Water Supply and Sewerage Schemes along with their implementation framework that will serve as a guidance document for BWSSB. It can then later identify and select individual projects that may be considered for implementation based on assessment of needs, its feasibility and priority. The vision document will also include broad cost estimates and time frame for implementation of the preferred strategy and option, as well as suggested and recommended phasing and staged implementation of the preferred option with a breakdown of investments into Long Term, Medium Term and Short Term timeframes with relevant finances and other resources required.</p>
