<h1><b>Preamble</b></h1>

<p>Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board is an autonomous body formed by the State legislature under Bangalore Water supply and Sewerage Board Act on 10-09-1964 for Water Supply &amp; Sewage disposal. It is one of the first Water supply &amp; Sanitation Utilities in India with jurisdiction of entire Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Area of 800 Sqkm, (Bengaluru Core area of 245 Sqkm, 8 Urban Local Bodies of 330 Sqkm ( 7 City Municipal Corporation and 1 Town Municipal Corporation and 110 Villages of 225 Sq kms.) It has the following mandates: adequate water supply to meet demand; creation of sewerage network &amp; safe disposal of sewage; Preparation, implementation of plans &amp; schemes for augmenting water supply &amp; safe disposal of sewage; Levy and collection of water charges on ‘no loss no profit basis’ for sustainability of the system.</p>

<p>Since its inception in the year 1964, BWSSB has executed several water supply and sewage schemes for the city, including the prestigious Cauvery Water Supply Scheme (CWSS) Stages - I, II, III &amp; Stage IV Phase - I, Phase - II and sewerage system improvement projects concentrating on sewage collection, conveyance and treatment works. The existing sewerage system covers an area of 265 km2 of core area of the city, in which three major Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) are constructed at Vrishabhavathi, K&amp;C and Hebbal Valleys (major and minor). The sewerage system for newly added areas mainly the erstwhile CMC’s is nearing completion.</p>

<b><h2> BWSSB jurisdictional area</h2></b>

<p><b>Overview of Water supply and sewerage System </b></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Bangalore, the capital city of Karnataka is the third largest city and the fifth largest metropolitan area in India and is one of the fastest growing metropolitan cities. It is a centre for education, IT &amp; BT industries, sophisticated high tech health care and many MNC industries which are attracting people to the city. As per Census 2011, the population of Bangalore city was about 8.5 million. The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is responsible for providing water supply to BBMP area of 800 sq. km.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Government of Karnataka allocated 19 TMC of water from Cauvery River for the water supply requirements of Bangalore City. In the year 2012, with the commissioning of the CWSS Stage IV, Phase II, the allocated water from Cauvery River has been exhausted. At present BWSSB is supplying treated Cauvery Water to Bangalore City under the Cauvery Water Supply Scheme (CWSS) Stage I, II, III &amp; Stage IV Phase I &amp; II with total installed capacity of 1310 MLD. This quantity of water provided to the core areas of BBMP including the erstwhile 7 CMC’s and 1 TMC area covering total area of 575 sq.km but excluding 110 village areas of BBMP covering 225 sq.km. In order to provide water supply to the newly added 110 villages which are part of BBMP, BWSSB is finding it difficult to meet the water requirements even after implementation of CWSS Stage IV, Phase II scheme.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Subsequently, the Urban Development Department, Govt. of Karnataka (GoK) allocated an additional 10 TMC (775 MLD) of Cauvery Water for Bangalore city. It is now necessary to formulate the CWSS Stage V scheme for Bangalore City and Detailed Project Report (DPR) has been prepared for getting the financial assistance from funding agencies, such as JICA (Japan International Co-operation Agency). Considering the technical aspects and water demand it is proposed to take up the Stage V Scheme in two Phases i.e., Phase I of 500 MLD (6.45 TMC) capacity and Phase II of 275 MLD (3.55 TMC) capacity.</span></p>

<h2><b>EXISTING WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM SCENARIO</b></h2>

<p>Till the year 1896, unfiltered water was supplied to Bangalore city in the Kalyani system from a number of tanks such as Dharmambudhi, Sampangi, Ulsoor, Sankey etc., supplemented by local wells and stepped ponds. The supply was inadequate from these tanks, hence, Arkavathi river was identified as the first large reliable source in the year 1884 and filtered water supply was started in the year 1896. Due to the continuous expansion of the city and the rapid growth of population, it became necessary to find and develop new sources. Cauvery River was identified for water supply and allocation of water from Cauvery river was done by Government of Karnataka (GoK). Since 1974, the Cauvery source has been developed in stages for water supply. This chapter discusses the schemes of river Arkavathi and River Cauvery which are the present sources of water.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">To supply filtered water to Bangalore City, Arkavathi source was identified in the year 1884. A reservoir was created at Hessarghatta about 18 kms to the North West of the city. An open masonry duct, 7 km long conveyed 29.5 Mld of raw water from source to Tarabanahalli and Soladevanahalli. From Tarabanahalli 7 Mld of water is supplied to Military. From Soladevanahalli 22.5 Mld water was pumped to city at a head of 125 m through, two 375 mm CI rising mains to Combined Jewel Filters (CJF), Malleshwaram where the water was treated. Treated water was first supplied after completing treatment plants at CJF on 7th August 1896.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Modification took place at Hessarghatta source by replacing masonry duct by 1050 mm diameter RCC Hume Pipe with a carrying capacity of about 36 Mld. One more rising main of 375 mm diameter was laid from Soladevanahalli. These three pipelines can carry 22.5 Mld water under normal conditions, out of which 13.5 Mld was supplied to the city and the balance water was supplied to enroute industries. Due to failure of monsoon, there is scarcity of water at source, only about 4 mld of water available was supplied to Military and Industries enroute in Peenya layout. This water is supplied as raw water because the treatment plant at CJF is not functioning and the receiving units such as HMT, Peenya layout and Defence establishments are having their own treatment facilities to treat this raw water. However, no water is being drawn at present from this source.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Thippagondanahalli (T.G.Halli)</b></h2>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">With the growth of the city the supply fell short of demand hence a new reservoir 'Chamaraja Sagar' near Thippagondanahalli (TG halli) was constructed in the year 1933 across the river Arkavathi, downstream of Hessarghatta reservoir about 26 km to the west of Bangalore. Water Treatment Plant is situated at the foot of the dam at T G halli. The first phase of the scheme was completed during March 1933 to augment the then supply by about 28 Mld. Subsequently, the abstraction was increased to 149 Mld by providing additional infrastructure such as increasing the capacity of the dam, providing additional treatment and pumping facility.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">This improvement is done by providing two stage pumping, the pumping head being 158 m at T G Halli and 168 m at Tavarekere which is the intermediate pumping station. Transmission system consists of 3 pumping mains of 600, 675 and 900 mm diameter CI pipes from T.G.Halli to CJF. Due to failure of monsoons and constraints in the existing pumping system only about 117 Mld is available most of the times and is supplied to West of Chord Road, Beggars Colony, Kethamaranahalli (KMH) and CJF after implementation of Cauvery stage III project. Due to continuous failure of monsoon, the reservoir last got filled in the year 1988. Presently there is no flow available. Because of these reasons Arkavathi zone reservoirs are also being fed with Cauvery water.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>CAUVERY WATER SUPPLY SCHEME</b></h2>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">A total supply of about 185 mld from the Arkavathi scheme was grossly inadequate to meet the demand of about 16 lakh population in the late sixties. Due to the continuous expansion of the city and the rapid growth of population it was necessary to identify new water supply sources. Cauvery River, which is about 86 km South of the city, is perennial and Government of Karnataka (GoK) allocated drinking water to BWSSB. Cauvery source is being developed in stages since 1974. Cauvery water supply scheme (CWSS) stage-I was commissioned in the year 1974 to augment the supply by 135 Mld. CWSS Stage-II followed and was commissioned in 1982 to further augment the supply by 135 Mld. CWSS Stage-III was commissioned in 1994-95, this stage augmented supplies by 270 mld. Cauvery water supply scheme (CWSS) stage-IV Phase I was commissioned in 2002 to augment supply by 270 Mld. CWSS Stage- IV Phase II followed and was commissioned in 2012 to further augment supply by 500 Mld. The salient features of the complete water supply system is shown in the tables below:</span></p>
